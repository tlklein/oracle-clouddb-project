# Oracle SQL Database Project

This repository contains a collection of Oracle SQL scripts and documents for various exercises in setting up, migrating, and managing databases using Oracle SQL Developer. These exercises aim to cover essential concepts such as querying for business purposes, migrating databases to the cloud, ensuring data integrity, automating processes with PL/SQL, and optimizing performance.


## Project Overview

This project is designed to help users understand and practice key concepts of Oracle SQL, particularly in the context of an IT Asset Management (ITAM) database. The exercises included here guide users through a range of topics, from querying and data migration to ensuring data integrity and automating repetitive tasks. The final exercise focuses on optimizing database performance, an essential skill for real-world applications.


## Exercise Breakdown

### EX 3: Queries for a Business Purpose

This exercise involves writing SQL queries to meet specific business requirements. It demonstrates how to retrieve and manipulate data to support decision-making processes.

- **Key Concepts**: SQL queries, SELECT statements, JOINs, filtering, grouping, and ordering data.


### EX 4: Migrate ITAM to the Cloud and Create Users

This exercise focuses on migrating the IT Asset Management database to Oracle Cloud and setting up user roles and permissions. It also covers user management and database security.

- **Key Concepts**: Data migration, user creation, cloud-based databases, and role management.


### EX 5: Constraints to Support Data Integrity

This exercise demonstrates the use of constraints to ensure data integrity in the database. Constraints such as `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `CHECK`, and `UNIQUE` are implemented to safeguard the quality and consistency of the data.

- **Key Concepts**: Data integrity, constraints, relational database design.


### EX 6: User-Defined Functions, Stored Procedures, and Triggers

This exercise covers automation using PL/SQL. Users will define functions, create stored procedures, and implement triggers to automate repetitive tasks and improve database efficiency.

- **Key Concepts**: PL/SQL, user-defined functions, stored procedures, triggers, automation.

### EX 7: Database and Query Performance

The final exercise focuses on optimizing database performance. Users will explore techniques such as indexing, query optimization, and monitoring tools to ensure the database runs efficiently.

- **Key Concepts**: Database performance tuning, indexing, query optimization, execution plans.


## Database Resources
This repository also includes the following resources related to the IT Asset Management database, the AP schema, and database tables:

- **IT Asset Management DB Diagram**: A visual representation of the IT Asset Management database structure.
- **AP Schema Diagram**: A visual representation of the AP schema.
- **Create ITAM & Murach Tables**: Use both folders called `student_create_itam` and `create_Murach_tables` to create the required database tables
