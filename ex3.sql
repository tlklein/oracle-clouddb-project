/* EX 3 Queries for a Business Purpose */

/* In EX 2 you inserted data into the IT asset management schema tables 
of user jaherna42. The tasks for this exercise refer to the IT asset management
tables belonging to user jaherna42 on the class server. 

The deliverable for this exercise is a Word document named 
ex3_lastname_firstname_section#.docx. Put your name and the exercise number 
(EX 3) as a heading in a Word document as you begin the exercise.*/

/*Here in the exercise instructions, you are prompted to (1) complete tasks, 
(2) take screen shots that document your hands-on work and insert them into 
the deliverable document, and/or (3) write something in the deliverable 
document. Use a tool to capture just the portion of the screen you need to 
document your work.

Whenever you capture work with a screenshot, include your name in the 
screenshot. This guideline applies to any screenshots you take to document your 
hands-on work throughout the semester. You may not get credit for something if 
you do not include your name as requested.

In addition to your name and your query in your screenshot, you should include 
some results and the All Rows Fetched: n in x.xxx seconds response from Oracle 
SQL Developer. Make sure n is the total number of rows fetched by scrolling to 
the end of the returned data. Include about 5 records of returned data (does 
not have to be exactly 5) in the screenshot, but do not use a where clause 
with num_rows to limit the number of rows retrieved. Often, it is not 
necessary to return all the columns if that makes the screenshot have too 
much white space on the right side.*/

/*Connect to the class server using your assigned username to complete the
tasks.*/

/* For each task of EX 3, do not get data from the it_asset_inv_summary table 
unless the task specifically asks you to do so. */

before XX AM in the MONTH and DD of YYYY, and that are no longer assigned for use 
by the same employee. When you retrieve date values, display the time value 
associated with the date as well as the date value (use the to_char function). 
Choose your own value of XX, your own value for MONTH, your own value for DD, and
your own value for YYYY. Hard code your personal chosen date/time value to be 
compared to in the where clause and make sure your query returns at least one 
row.

it_asset_inv_summary table is not kept up to date in an automated way, so use 
only data from other tables. */

/* ABCCo has several software apps built in-house that are shared and used by 
customers and potential customers who download one or more apps after registering
online with information that includes their location.

ABCCo wishes to track information about which download server is used the most 
by customers requesting a download. ABCCo is designing and building 
infrastructure to capture and record data about downloads. Your team is implementing 
and testing the backend for the information system being built.

There are ten download servers worldwide in different time zones. Customers are 
worldwide. The ten time zones for the servers are Africa/Lagos, Africa/Johannesburg, 
America/Chicago, America/La_Paz, America/New_York, America/Phoenix, Asia/Dubai, 
Asia/Manila, Europe/Dublin, and Europe/Prague.

Currently the download servers host 9 app versions:
app for registered customers v1.0 (regcust_app_v1.0),
app for registered customers v1.1 (regcust_app_v1.1),
app for registered customers v1.2 (regcust_app_v1.2),
app for subscription customers v1.0 (subsc_app_v1.0),
app for subscription customers v1.1 (subsc_app_v1.1),
app for subscription customers v1.2 (subsc_app_v1.2),
app for non-paying customers v1.0 (freecust_app_v1.0),
app for non-paying customers v1.1 (freecust_app_v1.1),
and app for non-paying customers v1.2 (freecust_app_v1.2)
which was recently released.

A table belonging to user JAHERNA42 holds data about app downloads. That table 
is named download. A table named customer is also created that contains 
customer information from the customer registration process. There is sample 
data in both tables.*/


/* Tasks 7 through 10 refer to the customer and download tables in the schema 
belonging to user JAHERNA42. */


/* Task 7 Most Recent App Downloads
Write a command to retrieve which app was downloaded recently, that is in 2024.
Find out when is was downloaded and the name of the customer who downloaded it. 
In a separate command, compare the time zone offset value for your time zone to 
the server time zone offset of the most recent downloaded app. A template for 
the second command is provided. */

/* Task 8 Time Zone Arithmetic
Subtract the most recent app download time from the current server time (as a 
timestamp with timezone value) to see what the day/time difference is between 
the two. In addition to the commands and output, write a sentence (as a comment)
to state what the data type of the difference you computed is. */

than Two Downloads

times for customers with more than two downloads. Include the customer names
in the result set. *Hint: Use the Task 9 query as a subquery with a having 
clause based on cust_id being in the result set of the Task 9 query.  */
